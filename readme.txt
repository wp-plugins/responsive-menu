This is a Highly Customisable Responsive Menu Created By Peter Featherstone @ Network Intellect.

== Description ==

This is a Highly Customisable Responsive Menu Plugin enabling you to change the: 
<br />
<ul>
<li> - Menu Title</li>
<li> - Menu Title Image</li>
<li> - Button Title</li>
<li> - Menu To Responsify</li>
<li> - Media Query Breakpoint Width</li>
<li> - CSS Options For Hiding Specific Elements</li>
<li> - Menu Depth To Display</li>
<li> - Top Location</li>
<li> - Right Percentage Location</li>
<li> - Line & Text Colour</li>
<li> - Background Colour</li>
<li> - Absolute and Fixed Positioning</li>
<li> - Menu Font</li>
<li> - Plus more...</li>
</ul>
The plugin creates a nice three-lined menu button that users can click to bring a slide out menu, which is easily navigated. Much better than those select drop-down menu's you see.
<br /><br />
The plugin is fully responsive if you have the viewport meta tag on your site, using media queries with the widths defined by you.
<br /><br />
It requires no shortcodes or fancy php code to be inserted by yourself making it very easy to install.
<br /><br />
It adds no extra HTTP requests to your site and the code added is extremely small (only a little jQuery and CSS).
